## Poem: Thin Blueshifted Line  
  
We all know that dread feeling when  
The siren comes to view.  
But I, a foolish man back then  
Thought I knew what to do.  
  
"Good morning, sir" he said to me,  
"I'll need your card and name.  
You ran a red light just back there;  
This ticket's for the same."  

"But officer," I tried to say,  
"It wasn't red for me!  
It must have blueshifted to green:  
It's all Lorentz, you see!"  
  
The officer of space then thought,  
And worked out what I'd said.  
"I'll let you off the hook, this time.  
For going on a red.  
  
But there's another ticket now,  
And bigger than before.  
You traveled at eighteen percent  
Of lightspeed, maybe more!"  
  
The moral: don't irk SP  
If you have any sense,  
And don't attempt to bluff them out:  
They all know their Lorentz.
