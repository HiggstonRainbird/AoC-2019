## Poem: The Key

Padlocked doors
Are all you see.
And every letter,
Has a key.

To travel first
from `a` to `b`
Would take too long
For every key.

Code up a state
With constants three:
`{x,y}`, the length,
And traversed key.

Make a cache
To some degree:
The distances
'Twixt every key.

And all the doors
from `A` to `Z`?
Note them if they
Block a key.

Combine the states
Which both agree
On all but length;
Repeat per key.

To beat the maze
And set you free,
Use Dijkstra.
*That's* the key.
