## Poem: One Thing Leads To Another

**Part 0: Examples**

You start with `ORE`  
And make some `A`,  
Since that's what the directions say.  

You make some `B`  
And then some `C`  
It's all as simple as can be,  

You make some `D`  
and then some `E`  
And lo! You've filled your tanks for free!  

You've cooked a bit   
and had your fun,  
And to make more  
Just add some `ORE`.  

**Part 1: Recursion**

You know the `FUEL` you need to make,  
But don't know how much `ORE` to take.  

To make `FUEL` you need 10 `XY`  
And 7 `Z` and 15 `I`  

And to make `Z` you need `MN`,  
And that requires `I` again,  

And down and down the hole you go  
But there's at least a floor below:  

If all that's in the stack is `ORE`  
You've landed safely on that floor.  

**Part 2: Insanity**

The depth of my recursion now knows nary an upper bound;  
The math to make a trillion `FUEL` will eat a coder whole.  
Naively, I have multiplied, but all that I have found  
Are `Ceiling[]`s placed upon my code, that trap only my soul.  

A day, a night, and I remain, in torment, at my screen,  
A dozen drafts I've thrown aside, and hope, and sunlight too.  
To sort it by topology, the best chance I have seen  
To leave this labyrinth of code, this maze of white and blue.  

I make the list into a graph, and careful do I tread,  
I walk and hope that each new part needs but what came before.  
The shield that is recursion, gone, I walk and shake with dread  
Until, at last, I reemerge, and know the `FUEL` and `ORE`.  

**Part 3: Triumph**

If I should go out to the stars,  
And need some `FUEL` to make it,  
And if I'll want to calculate  
The `ORE`, and not mistake it...  

I'll take around  
The upper bound,  
And then take more,  
Just to be sure.
