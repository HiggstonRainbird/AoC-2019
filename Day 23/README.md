## Poem: A Sonnet of Networking

We are the unsung heroes who set sail.  
We've flown through space, and touched old Triton's soil.  
And like the bees of Virgil's epic tale,  
We hum and buzz in unison, to toil.  

But Virgil and his bees could not compete,  
And nor could any errant Carthiginian.  
Our network is by far man's greatest feat  
(Though you may disagree with that opinion).  

And though our pilot has the smarts of bricks  
(His tractor beam produced the ship's condition  
And tried to get a trillion cards to mix)  
He knows we're vital to his greater mission.  

For when he sets a course out through the air,  
He knows our NAT and queues will get him there.
