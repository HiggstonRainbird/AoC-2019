## Poem: De Morgan's Dream

> Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em  
> And little fleas have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum.  
> And the great fleas themselves, in turn, have greater fleas to go on;  
> While these again have greater still, and greater still, and so on.  

-- Augustus De Morgan, *A Budget of Paradoxes*

De Morgan had a dream one night  
In which he flew and flew.  
He dreamed he flew by every world,  
And dreamed of Eris too.  

And in that dream, he saw some fleas  
All in a tiny grid.  
They hopped around and lived and died  
As he watched what they did.  

He landed there (not liking fleas,  
And wouldn't you agree?).  
He walked through every square he saw  
And stepped on every flea.  

But minutes passed, and flea appeared  
That seemed to spawn from void.  
He didn't know of Pluto's race;  
He watched, and was annoyed.  

The mystery he dreamed about  
But couldn't quite unpack:  
"Where are all these fleas coming from  
And how to send them back?"  

De Morgan tossed and turned that night,  
And when he woke from bed.  
He wrote down all the dreams of bugs  
That had been in his head.  

De Morgan couldn't end the tale,  
But we know what to do:  
We know cellular automata,  
And bugs...  

We've seen a few.
