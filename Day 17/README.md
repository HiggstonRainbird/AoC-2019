## Poem: ABABCCBCBA

A flare now billows outward from the sun's unceasing glare.  
It menaces the ship with its immense electric field.  
And scaffolding outside the ship, and bots all stationed there  
Would fry if they remained in place, the wrong side of the shield.  

Your tools: an ASCII camera, a vaccuum bot for dust,  
Schematics of the scaffolding.  Not much, but try you must.  
First, you need your bearings: when the junctions are revealed  
You will know just where your vacuum bot can put its wheels and trust.  

Map all the turns of scaffolding, and `ZIP` them tightly sealed,  
Then, map compressed, send out the bot, with not a tick to spare.
