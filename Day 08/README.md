## Poem: A Sonnet of Sojourning

	The crimson world that roams around our sun
	Has myriads of regions to explore.
	The places where once water might have run
	The places where spirits might one day soar.

	But we, dependent on our verdant home,
	Have not the opportunity to tread
	Upon that distant dirt of sand and loam,
	And so we send out vikings in our stead.
	
	So what befell those brave explorers there
	Sojourning all alone, so sure to die?
	Where once they trekked Martian dust and air
	They are entombed beneath the Martian sky.
	
	And for those valiant pathfinders who fell,
	Their crimson tomb is Heaven and not Hell.
