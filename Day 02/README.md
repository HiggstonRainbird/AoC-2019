## Poem: A Sonnet of Magic Smoke

If you wish to care for an old machine,
No matter if PC, Red Hat, or Mac,
There is a part which you must not demean: 
A genie that, when freed, will not come back.

When servers say to "Halt" and then "Catch Fire",
The fire lets the smoke out through the fans.
This magic smoke, it ran your system, prior.
And cannot be replaced by mortal hands.

If e'er a man should hear this and object,
If he cries 'superstition!' or 'That's wrong!',
Do not trust him, or leave his code unchecked;
For he will not posses his smoke for long.

And if that man approaches, bar the door!
If he lets loose your smoke, there is no more.
