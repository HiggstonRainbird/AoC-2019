## Poem: I'd Like To Thank The Academy

Note: I got third place on part 1 and first place on part 2 of today's problem.  This was due to exceptionally specific circumstances about the problem and will never happen again, so I'm making the most of it!

	You had a dozen problems which
	Were practically a spoiler.
	Your 'repunits' I used to curse.
	'Repeated digit' problems? Worse.
	But they all helped me to rehearse,
	So thank you, Project Euler.
	
	You wrote up Mathematica,
	Which later you called 'Wolfram'.
	Your ego might be vast as time,
	'No open source' might feel like slime,
	Your name might be real tough to rhyme,
	But thank you, Stephen Wolfram.

	You wrote the puzzle for today
	(And took my bribe, so great!)
	For Perl and Wolfram must unite
	Against the all-consuming blight,
	Since Python wins most every night,
	So thank you, Topaz...8.
