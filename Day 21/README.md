# Mathematica Advent of Code    
# 2019, Day 21
      
My code for today is unusual - it's an optimized random search on an emulator of the various hole configurations, rather than any kind of rational design.

**Part 1:**

    NOT C T
    AND J T
    OR A T
    OR B J
    NOT T J
    NOT C J
    AND C T
    NOT T J
    AND D J
    NOT A T
    NOT A T

**Part 2:**

    NOT F J
    NOT A J
    AND D J
    OR A J
    AND C J
    OR F J
    AND D J
    OR F J
    AND A J
    AND B J
    AND I T  
    NOT T T  
    NOT J J  
    AND D J
      
      
## Poem: Watch Your Step

A disaster, then, briefly, a lull,
So I sent out a springdroid to mull.
But when I tried to pull
All its springscript was full,
So it fell through a hole in the hull.
