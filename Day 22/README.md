## Poem: Scrambled

To mix one hundred trillion cards
One-hundred-trillion-fold
Cannot be done by mortal hands
And shouldn't be, all told.

The cards make razors look like bricks;
An atom, side to side.
And even so, the deck itself,
Is fourteen km wide.

The kind of hands you'd need to have,
To pick out every third,
From cards that thin and decks that wide?
It's, plain to say, absurd!

And then, a hundred trillion times?
The time brings me to tears!
One second each per shuffle, say:
Three point one million years!

Card games are fun, but this attempt?
Old age will kill you dead.
You still have an arcade in here...
How 'bout Breakout instead?
