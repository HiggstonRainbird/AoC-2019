## Poem: With Apologies to Joyce Kilmer

	I think that I shall never see
	A poem named quite like a tree.
	
	A tree whose 'root' is overhead,
	A tree whose height is 'depth' instead.
	
	Whose 'branches' go down fathoms deep;
	Whose 'leaves' support the hefty 'heap'.

	A 'family' tree, with 'children' who
	Have just one 'parent' each, not two.
	
	A tree that's just a type a graph;
	A 'forest' when it's split in half.
	
	Poems are named by fools like me...
	A bigger fool must name a tree.
