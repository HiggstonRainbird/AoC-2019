## Poem: Off By One

How can a man learn fully and correct  
Against the anger that frustration brings him?  
When after algorithms had been checked  
An error, off-by-one, lurks out and stings him?  

The disconnect between "it is" and "ought"  
May be well be infinite for a machine.  
The man must know his code's not what he thought;  
He cannot simply say "Do what I mean".  

A fitting line, then, from an ancient ode,  
And recollected wrong, from slumbering:  
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our code,  
But in ourselves, and in our numbering."  

For if that man should know not what he's done,  
His tractor beams will all be off by one.
