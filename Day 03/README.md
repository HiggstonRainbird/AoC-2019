## Poem: Maze in Manhattan

	In New York, if you decide to
	Walk through blindly, only tied to
	Ariadne's yarn to guide you,
	You won't lose your way.

	But if you should cross a wire,
	Left by someone else entire,
	"How might I" you might inquire,
	"Go back there someday?"

	Notch your yarn out once a meter;
	Keep a compass and repeater,
	So you're ready, when you meet her,
	To deduce the place,

	Where (part 1) your home was nearest,
	Where (part 2) your signal clearest,
	Where your yarn that you held dearest
	Crossed another's space.
