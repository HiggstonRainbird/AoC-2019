## Poem: A Ballade of Advent

We grabbed the fuel to launch and fly our sleigh;  
Then paused to get some opcodes to our name.  
We traced a maze of wires gone astray;  
And found a word with many parts the same.  
At Mercury we didn't set aflame,  
But transferred orbits, counting all the way,  
And tied ourselves in loops to play the game  
Of puzzles leading up to Christmas Day.  

On Mars we helped a rover castaway,  
And then, near Ceres, opcodes all were done.  
The asteroids, we blew up with a ray.  
The moons, we watched, as they all danced and spun.  
We made some `FUEL` from `ORE`, all one by one  
Before a tractor caught us (much dismay!).  
Though fixing Intcode could be less than fun  
The ints all counted down to Christmas Day.  

We 'borrowed' Triton's tractor beam array  
Then worked through Pluto's mazes, dark and dim.  
We wrecked the hull with 'harmless' tractor play,  
But shuffled lots of cards ('twas that or gym).  
And though 'cat 6 disaster' sounded grim,  
'Infinities of bugs' is worse, I'd say.  
But we reached Santa, pockets stuffed to brim,  
And found one final star on Christmas Day.

Prince Topaz, you made all this on a whim,  
And mods, you kept the entropy at bay.  
Dear readers, may you all be blessed by Him  
Who long ago was born on Christmas Day.
