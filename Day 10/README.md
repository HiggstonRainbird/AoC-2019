## Poem: The Hunting of the Asteroids  
    
The wild, roaming asteroids,  
Are quite the fearsome prey.  
They're known to hide inside a pack  
To sneak up first, and then attack,  
The instant you have turned your back,  
Or let your thoughts astray.  
  
To try to count the asteroids  
Is only fit for fools.  
They'll sit inside your line of sight  
No matter where you think you might  
Place viewing stands to see their flight,  
Or try to learn their rules.  
  
The hunting of the asteroids  
Is very seldom taught:  
No need to tell 'twixt friend and foe,  
No need to spare a fawn or doe:  
With laser beams, you rotate slow   
And vaporize the lot.
