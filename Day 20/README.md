## Poem: A Sonnet from AA to ZZ

0) An Appetite for interesting sights
1) (eXcept For Eris; bugs aren't fun at all)
2) Conspired Kindly to bring me to spots
3) Zipped High above by pilots more banal.

4) Why Bother?  'Cause I'm curious and bored.
5) I Can't resist distraction.  Never could.
6) Resistance?  Futile, far as I'm concerned;
7) Never met a puzzle and said "I'm good".

8) Lost?  Perhaps.  This maze is rather large.
9) For Dungeons, Pluto's sure do take the cake.
10) `XQ` is next, and down and down I go;
9) Walking Backwa...wait, backwards?

I'm trying to find the exit?  Nothing more?
No treasure at its heart?  Then what's it for?
